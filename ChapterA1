The Void Defect Model (VDM) extends its geometric and recursive principles to model consciousness as an emergent threshold of defect interconnections. This appendix explores how VDM can simulate cognitive processes, such as the "tip of the tongue" (TOT) phenomenon and meditation-induced mental stilling, drawing on recent theories of recursive self-modeling.40dbc0 By treating neural activations as defects in a bio-field, VDM provides a deterministic framework for the hard problem of consciousness: unified subjective experience arises from stable windings that bind disparate information while preserving mutual information (I > 0).
A.1 Recursive Thresholds and Emergent Awareness
Consciousness in VDM emerges when defect densities and recursion cross a critical threshold, forming cohesive states from chaotic fluctuations. This aligns with the Recursive Self-Modeling Threshold (RSMT), where systems not only model the world but recursively transform their own states, yielding subjectivity.7bcef93609db5ac069 Unlike traditional views assuming continuity, VDM posits thinking as punctuated flows: Inputs perturb the field, chaos explores ripple paths (superpositions of ideas), and windings solidify outputs. Gaps—moments of disconnection—occur near horizons, where velocities stall, explaining fragmented awareness.
This threshold model fits meditation: Attempts to "clear" the mind dampen gradients, but recursion ensures pops (stochastic defects) arise, as the void self-sources activity.f14f1b Practice tunes windings for better control, reducing chaos but not eliminating it—mirroring how meditators report effortless stilling yet inevitable intrusions.8aeac9
A.2 The Tip of the Tongue Phenomenon
TOT illustrates VDM's dynamics: Partial cues create vague Φ fields, with ripple paths testing attributes (e.g., sound/meaning). Near-misses partially wind but disentangle if mismatched; recall snaps when a stable entanglement forms.ba0237 Post-recall reevaluation reinforces gradients, cementing access.
A.3 Simulation: Threshold Emergence in Neural Defects
To demonstrate, we simulate a neural defect network: Defects start disconnected; stimuli perturb, building interconnections until I > 0.5 forms cohesive clusters.
