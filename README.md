## What Is This?

The Void Defect Model (VDM) is a unified theory that explains how recursive geometry and material defects drive emergent complexity across scales. It reinterprets quantum mechanics, gravity, particle physics, chemistry, biology, and consciousness as deterministic phenomena arising from defects in a self-interacting void field. This repo houses the full VDM manuscript, simulation data, fabrication workflows, and teaching tools to help you explore and extend the model.

## Why It Matters

VDM proposes shifting from electron-centric energy models toward a geometry-first paradigm that leverages natural motifs and defect structures. It offers a blueprint for real devicesâ€”fold-resonators, crystal harvesters, metamaterial analogsâ€”and suggests new directions in wireless energy transmission, high-density compounds, and synthetic biology. Philosophically, it reframes the universe as a self-sourcing, purposive system driven by an entropic arrow of complexity.
